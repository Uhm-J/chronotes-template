# Frontend

The React frontend is built with Vite and shadcn/ui components.

## Development

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer.
2. Run `npm install` inside the `frontend` directory.
3. Start the dev server with `npm run dev`.

The development server runs on `http://localhost:5173` by default. After building with `npm run build` the static files can be served by the Go backend.
